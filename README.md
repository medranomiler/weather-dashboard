# weather-dashboard

##Description 
This weather app allows you the user to search for a city's current weather data and five day weather forecast. All previously searched cities are also listed on the left side of the page and the list updates after the page is refreshed. This is also a challenge for unit 6 of the UTA Coding Bootcamp
